# The long road to Async/Await in JavaScript

This is a comparison of different methods for performing asynchronous control flow in JavaScript, specifically Callbacks, Promises, Generators / Yields (ES2015), and Async / Await (ES2016). We will explore a simple code example as it applies to each of these different "phases" of asynchronous control flow. Finally we'll examine how Async functions are just Promises under the hood and that the two are interoperable.

## Friends don't let friends Cluster

This talk first covers the `cluster` module, how it works conceptually, and how it compares to the `child_process` module. Next, HAProxy is examined, which is a reverse proxy capable of solving the same problems as `cluster`. Finally, the performance of both technologies are measured, both in throughput and memory consumption.

Material is based on Thomas's upcoming book, tentatively titled _Distributed Node.js_.
